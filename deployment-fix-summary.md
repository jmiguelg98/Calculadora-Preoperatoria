# Calculator App Deployment Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem
Your calculator app was showing a blank page when deployed to GitHub Pages, despite working correctly in your VS Code development environment.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Tailwind CSS Configuration
**Primary Issue**: The main cause of the blank page was missing Tailwind CSS configuration. Your CSS file (`src/index.css`) was using custom Tailwind colors like:
- `medical-primary`
- `medical-secondary` 
- `medical-gray-*` variants
- Custom shadows like `shadow-medical`

Without a `tailwind.config.js` file defining these colors, Tailwind couldn't compile the styles properly, resulting in broken or missing CSS that made content invisible.

### 2. Incorrect Homepage Configuration
**Secondary Issue**: In your `package.json`, the `homepage` property was incorrectly placed inside the `scripts` section instead of being a top-level property.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Created Tailwind Configuration
Created `tailwind.config.js` with proper color definitions:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'medical-primary': '#CB182E',
        'medical-secondary': '#A61520',
        'medical-gray-100': '#F3F4F6',
        'medical-gray-200': '#E5E7EB',
        'medical-gray-300': '#D1D5DB',
        'medical-gray-700': '#374151',
        'medical-gray-900': '#111827',
      },
      boxShadow: {
        'medical': '0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### 2. Fixed Package.json Configuration
Moved the `homepage` property to the correct location:
```json
{
  "homepage": "https://jmiguelg98.github.io/Calculadora-Preoperatoria/",
  "scripts": {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Evidence of Fix
- **CSS file size**: Increased from 607 B to 4.49 kB after adding Tailwind config, indicating styles are now properly compiled
- **Build success**: Project builds without errors
- **Deployment success**: Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages

## Your App Should Now Work
Your calculator app should now display properly at: `https://jmiguelg98.github.io/Calculadora-Preoperatoria/`

The app includes:
- Patient information form
- Medication management calculator
- Creatinine clearance calculator
- Decision tree for preoperative medication management
- Results display with PDF export functionality

## Prevention for Future Projects
1. Always create a `tailwind.config.js` when using custom Tailwind classes
2. Ensure `homepage` is a top-level property in `package.json` for GitHub Pages
3. Test the build locally before deploying: `npm run build` and serve the build folder
4. Check that all custom CSS classes have corresponding definitions
