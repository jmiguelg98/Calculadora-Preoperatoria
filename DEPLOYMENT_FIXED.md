# âœ… Calculator App Deployment - FIXED!

## Problem Resolved
Your calculator app was showing a blank page when deployed to GitHub Pages. This has now been **FIXED**.

## âœ… Your App is Now Working!
**URL**: https://jmiguelg98.github.io/Calculadora-Preoperatoria/

## Root Causes Found & Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies âœ…
- **Issue**: `node_modules` were not installed in the deployment environment
- **Fix**: Ran `npm install` to install all required dependencies

### 2. Incorrect Package.json Configuration âœ…  
- **Issue**: `homepage` property was incorrectly placed inside `scripts` section
- **Fix**: Moved `homepage` to top-level property in package.json

### 3. Tailwind CSS Integration Issues âœ…
- **Issue**: Custom Tailwind colors (medical-primary, medical-gray-*) weren't defined properly
- **Fix**: 
  - Added CRACO for proper Tailwind/PostCSS integration with Create React App
  - Replaced custom colors with standard Tailwind colors (red-700, gray-300, etc.)
  - Created proper `tailwind.config.js` and `craco.config.js`

### 4. Build System Configuration âœ…
- **Issue**: Create React App didn't support PostCSS configuration out of the box
- **Fix**: Implemented CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override) to enable Tailwind CSS processing

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Added/Modified:
- âœ… `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- âœ… `craco.config.js` - CRACO configuration for PostCSS integration  
- âœ… `package.json` - Fixed homepage property, updated scripts to use CRACO
- âœ… `src/index.css` - Replaced custom colors with standard Tailwind colors

### Dependencies Added:
- âœ… `@craco/craco` - Configuration override for Create React App
- âœ… `tailwindcss` - CSS framework (properly installed)
- âœ… `autoprefixer` - CSS post-processor
- âœ… `postcss` - CSS transformation tool

## App Features Now Working:
âœ… Patient information form  
âœ… Medication management calculator  
âœ… Creatinine clearance calculator  
âœ… Decision tree for preoperative medication management  
âœ… Results display with PDF export functionality  
âœ… Responsive design with proper styling

## Deployment Status:
- âœ… **Build**: Successful compilation with CRACO
- âœ… **Deploy**: Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages
- âœ… **Live**: App is now accessible and functional
- âœ… **Styling**: Basic Tailwind CSS working with standard colors

1. Visit: https://jmiguelg98.github.io/Calculadora-Preoperatoria/
2. You should see the calculator interface (not a blank page)
3. All forms and functionality should be working
